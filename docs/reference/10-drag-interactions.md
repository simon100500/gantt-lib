# Drag Interactions

| User Action | Result |
|---|---|
| Click and drag center of task bar | Move task. Both `startDate` and `endDate` shift by the same delta. Snaps to day boundaries. |
| Click and drag left edge (12px zone) | Resize task start date (earlier or later). Right edge stays fixed. Snaps to day boundaries. |
| Click and drag right edge (12px zone) | Resize task end date (earlier or later). Left edge stays fixed. Snaps to day boundaries. |
| Click and drag empty grid area | Pan (scroll) the chart horizontally and vertically. Cursor changes to `grabbing`. |

**Edge zone priority:** Resize takes priority over move when the cursor is within 12px of either horizontal edge.

**Drag tooltip:** During drag, a tooltip displays the current start and end dates of the task being dragged.

**onTasksChange timing:** `onTasksChange` fires exactly once on `mouseup`, not during drag. This prevents re-render storms when 100+ tasks are in the array. During drag, only the dragged row re-renders internally.

**Snapping:** All drag operations snap to full day boundaries. Sub-day positioning is not supported.
